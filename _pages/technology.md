Our software runs on specialised systems, using X86 and GPU (and TPU in 2019).  


We have trained a network to fill in the gaps in the large structures allowing the computation to progress using traditional techniques.  This in effect replaces grid refinement techniques.  We are now leveraging that knowledge to use ML in post processing, and in situ feature detection.
