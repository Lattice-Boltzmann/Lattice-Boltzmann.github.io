"Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) is a class of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for fluid simulation. Instead of solving the Navierâ€“Stokes equations directly, a fluid density on a lattice is simulated with streaming and collision (relaxation) processes[1]. The method is versatile[1] as the model fluid can straightforwardly be made to mimic common fluid behaviour like vapour/liquid coexistence, and so fluid systems such as liquid droplets can be simulated. Also, fluids in complex environments such as porous media can be straightforwardly simulated, whereas with other CFD methods the complex boundaries there can be hard to work with." Wikipedia
